    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>Beef Bulgogi is a Korean dish that consists of marinaded and fried flank steak with peppers and onions. This dish is often served with white rice and a combination of Korean side dishes. I am a huge fan of this dish, and usually alternate between it and spicy pork when I am eating Korean food.</p>
