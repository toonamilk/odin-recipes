        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
            <p>This reciple takes the classic southern dish of mac' and cheese and turns it into a (pardon my language) <strong><em>freaking pie!</em></strong> Macaroni and cheese is one of my personal favorites and I make it every thanksgiving. I haven't personally tried this recipe, but I plan on giving it a shot next time I make this delicious dish of cheesy goodness.</p>
            <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>cooking spray</li>
                    <li>2 cups uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
                    <li>2 (12 ounce) cans evaporated milk</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
                    <li>3 eggs</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>4 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>1 pinch paprika, or to taste (Optional)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
                    <li>Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil. Stir in the macaroni and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until it has cooked through but is still slightly firm, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
                    <li>Slowly melt butter in a large pot over low heat. Stir in evaporated milk and black pepper; cook until heated through.</li>
                    <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl until smooth; whisk about 1/2 cup of the evaporated milk mixture into the eggs, 1 tablespoon at a time, until thoroughly incorporated. Whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan with evaporated milk mixture. Continue to heat gently, whisking constantly, until the evaporated milk mixture almost comes to a simmer and the sauce thickens.</li>
                    <li>Gently mix salt and cooked macaroni into the sauce and stir to combine.</li>
                    <li>Spoon 1/4 of the macaroni mixture in a layer into the bottom of the prepared casserole dish and top with 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. Repeat layers three more times; top last cheese layer with paprika to taste.</li>
                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven un til casserole is bubbling, about 20 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
