<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>Pizza pizza! This is a dish that we all know and love, and if you don't, then I don't love you, and I also hope that I don't know you! I have fond memories of getting a $5.00 "Hot and Ready" pizza from Little Ceasers as a kid, I always looked forward to those pizza nights. But little did I know, there is much better pizza out there. It comes in all shapes and sizes, there's pan pizza, stuff crust pizza, deep dish pizza, New York style pizza, and much more! This reciple is for a basic DIY Pepperoni pizza. Enjoy!</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<h4><em>Sauce</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 (12 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>

        <h4><em>Crust</em></h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 1/4 cups all-purpose flower, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) packets of pizza yeast or rapid rising yeast</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)</li>
            <li>1/3 cup oil</li>

            <h4>Toppings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (6 ounce) package of pepperoni</li>
                <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>


            </ul>





        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
            <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRiseÂ® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
</ol>






    </ul>
